question: Manchester City, on and off the field, are leaving @placeholder behind. context: How could Manchester United go from being champions in 2013 to being so unrecognisably bad now? Yes, Louis van Gaal is the first stop when it comes to taking responsibility for the current blunders but there is more to it than that. I'm wondering if Sir Alex Ferguson is ready to put his hand up and accept some of the blame. It seems a bit too easy to trot out the standard lines: 'Van Gaal is useless' or 'it's Wayne Rooney's fault'. Some are so incredibly rude they're declaring Van Gaal is too old. Sharper analysis is required. For such a great club to have fallen on such hard times (by their own extraordinarily high standards) and look so devoid of the verve and energy they used to have, must be down not just to what the current manager is doing. No, it must also involve more long-term mistakes and misguided thinking. @highlight Manchester United were beaten 2-1 by Bournemouth on Saturday evening @highlight Louis van Gaal has come in for a lot of criticism in the aftermath of defeat @highlight But Sir Alex Ferguson failed to leave a legacy when he left Old Trafford @highlight Legendary boss had lost touch with the modern game in his later years @highlight United's entire youth system has been left with an inferiority complex @highlight Double your Fantasy Football points with Power Play code sanchez69 @highlight Get an extra  Fantasy Football transfer this week with the code henderson61	Manchester United
question: Ashley Cole (right) moved to Roma last summer and @placeholder could join him in what is a 'lovely place' context: Liverpool defender Glen Johnson looks certain to leave Anfield when his contract expires this summer as he looks at clubs which he feels could help 'turn around his career'. Johnson was a late substitute in Liverpool's 1-0 win over Swansea City on Monday night but is already looking for a new club despite Brendan Rodgers' attempts to keep hold of the England full back. It seems likely that Johnson will follow the example of fellow English full back Ashley Cole and opt for a move abroad when his deal expires, though there is a chance he could stay in the Barclays Premier League is the right move comes up. @highlight Liverpool's Glen Johnson is out of contract at Anfield in the summer @highlight He seems certain to leave as he looks to 'turn around his career' @highlight Roma have been linked with the player but are yet to get in touch @highlight Johnson's agent says 'Rome would be a lovely place for him' @highlight He was an 88th-minute substitute in Liverpool's 1-0 win over Swansea City @highlight CLICK HERE for all the latest Liverpool news	Glen Johnson
question: 'But he is still a member of @placeholder and he said he will come out on July 25.' context: Paris Saint-Germain believe they can finalise a deal for Angel di Maria this weekend. The Argentine has been told he will have more chance of playing following Robin van Persie's sale to Fenerbahce but his departure will prompt another dip into the transfer market from United. They were willing to go with the forward options they have for the tour and take stock later in the window of who they could buy but Di Maria's departure would change their outlook. West Ham's proposed move for Javier Hernandez may also come under threat as United consider keeping holding of the Mexico international. @highlight Manchester United misfit Angel di Maria is a target for Paris Saint-Germain @highlight The Ligue 1 giants are confident they can the seal deal in the coming days @highlight He has been told he will play more following Robin van Persie's departure @highlight However, Di Maria's long-term United future is less than certain @highlight READ: What has gone wrong for Di Maria at Manchester United?

question: To be in @placeholder's home is to know how deeply she loved her husband. context: Victoria Milligan is trying to ignore the fact that it is Father's Day tomorrow.

Her 'we' used to be a particularly blessed family of six that included her 'gorgeous husband', senior Sky executive Nick, their seven-year-old son Kit and daughters Amber, 14, Olivia, 12, and Emily, who should be ten. But Emily died at the age of eight in a horrific speedboat accident in Cornwall that also killed her father.

question: "The people of Haiti have long deserved more than just acknowledgment for the pain and sacrifice they have suffered in great part due to @placeholder negligence. context: (CNN) The United Nations did not do enough to prevent the spread of cholera epidemic in Haiti that killed at least 10,000 people after the 2010 earthquake, Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon said Thursday in his first formal apology for the outbreak. To many, the apology was long overdue. The UN denied claims that Nepalese peacekeepers brought cholera to the island nine months after the devastating earthquake, the first known appearance of the disease there in over 150 years. Scientists, victims' families and advocacy groups accused peacekeepers of spreading cholera through improper sanitation disposal at their base near a river. With a month left in his term, Ban issued the carefully worded apology as part of an announcement of a new plan to eradicate the disease. @highlight Advocacy groups blame UN peacekeepers in Haiti for bringing cholera to island @highlight UN has long denied it is responsible @highlight Moon calls epidemic a "blemish" on UN peacekeepers' reputation	UN
question: While @placeholder feels a strange connection to Lazamana, she does have mixed emotions about the way the teen's actions threatened her own life and totaled her family's only car. context: Following the tragic suicide of a 13-year-old girl in Washington State last month, the woman whose car the desperate teen fell onto after dropping off a bridge is speaking out. Chelci Frutos was driving to work along Interstate 5 in Tacoma on May 29 when she saw an object drop out of the sky. 'I saw a long black ponytail as she was falling,' Frutos told The Washington Post.
